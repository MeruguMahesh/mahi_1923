197. What is the ideal number of disks for RAID 5?  
    A) At least three disks for optimal performance and redundancy.

198. How should you handle RAID backup strategies?  
    A) Always have external backups in addition to RAID redundancy.

199. What RAID level is best for archival storage?  
    A) RAID 6 for redundancy and capacity.

200. How do you safely remove a disk from a RAID array?  
    A) Use `mdadm remove` and ensure the disk is not in use.

201. What should you monitor in RAID health checks?  
    A) Disk status, array status, and performance metrics.

202. What is the purpose of testing RAID configurations?  
    A) To ensure data integrity and performance under load.
